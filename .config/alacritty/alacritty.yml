# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty it self.
env:
  # TERM env customization.
  #
  # If this property is not set, alacritty will set it to xterm-256color.
  #
  # Note that some xterm terminfo databases don't declare support for italics.
  # You can verify this by checking for the presence of `smso` and `sitm` in
  # `infocmp xterm-256color`.
  TERM: xterm-256color

window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)
  #
  # Specified in number of columns/lines, not pixels.
  # If both are `0`, this setting is ignored.
  dimensions:
    columns: 80
    lines: 24

  # Window padding (changes require restart)
  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is not scaled
  # by DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.
  padding:
    x: 30
    y: 30

  # Window decorations
  #
  # Available values:
  # - `full`: Window with title bar and title bar buttons
  # - `none`: Window without title bar, rounded corners, or drop shadow
  # - `transparent`: Window with title bar with transparent background and title
  #   bar buttons
  # - `buttonless`: Window with title bar with transparent background and no
  #   title bar buttons
  decorations: none

scrolling:
  # Maximum number of lines in the scrollback buffer.
  # Specifying '0' will disable scrolling.
  history: 10000

  # Number of lines the viewport will move for every line scrolled when
  # scrollback is enabled (history > 0).
  multiplier: 6

  # Scroll to the bottom when new text is written to the terminal.
  auto_scroll: false

# Spaces per Tab (changes require restart)
#
# This setting defines the width of a tab in cells.
#
# Some applications, like Emacs, rely on knowing about the width of a tab.
# To prevent unexpected behavior in these applications, it's also required to
# change the `it` value in terminfo when altering this setting.
tabspaces: 2

# When true, bold text is drawn using the bright variant of colors.
# ll
draw_bold_text_with_bright_colors: false

# Font configuration (changes require restart)
#
# Important font attributes like antialiasing, subpixel aa, and hinting can be
# controlled through fontconfig. Specifically, the following attributes should
# have an effect:
#
# * hintstyle
# * antialias
# * lcdfilter
# * rgba
#
# For instance, if you wish to disable subpixel antialiasing, you might set the
# rgba property to "none". If you wish to completely disable antialiasing, you
# can set antialias to false.
#
# Please see these resources for more information on how to use fontconfig

# Visual Bell
#
# Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once
# rung, the terminal background will be set to white and transition back to the
# default background color. You can control the rate of this transition by
# setting the `duration` property (represented in milliseconds). You can also
# configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.
#
# Possible values for `animation`
# `Ease`
# `EaseOut`
# `EaseOutSine`
# `EaseOutQuad`
# `EaseOutCubic`
# `EaseOutQuart`
# `EaseOutQuint`
# `EaseOutExpo`
# `EaseOutCirc`
# `Linear`

# To completely disable the visual bell, set its duration to 0.
